When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself 
beneath this, and cried — 

" Rapunzel, Rapunzel, 
Let down thy hair to me." 

Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and 
when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened 
her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks 
of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells 
down, and the enchantress climbed up by it. 

After a year or two, it came to pass that the King's son 
rode through the forest and went by the tower; there he 
heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still 
and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude 
passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The 
King's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the 
door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode 
home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart that 
every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. 
Once, when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that 
an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried — 

" Rapunzel, Rapunzel, 
Let down thy hair." 

Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the 
enchantress climbed up to her. " If that is the ladder by 
which one mounts, I will for once try my fortune, " said he ;
and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to 
the tower and cried — 

"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, 
Let down thy hair." 

Immediately the hair fell down and the King's son 
climbed up. 

At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man 
such as her eyes had never yet beheld came to her ; but the 
King's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and 
told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let 
him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then 
Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would 
take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young 
and handsome, she thought, " He will love me more than 
old Dame Gothel does ; " and she said yes, and laid her 
hand in his. She said, " I will willingly go away with thee, 
but I do not know how to get down. Bring with thee a 
skein of silk every time that thou comest, and I will weave 
a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and 
thou wilt take me on thy horse. " They agreed that, until 
that time, he should always come to see her in the evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress 
remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her, 
" Tell me. Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so 
much heavier for me to draw up than the young King's 
son — he is with me in a moment." "Ah! thou wicked 
child," cried the enchantress, " what do I hear thee say? 
I thought I had separated thee from all the world, and yet 
thou hast deceived me ! " In her anger she clutched 
Rapunzel 's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her 
left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and, snip, 
snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the 
ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and 
misery.
