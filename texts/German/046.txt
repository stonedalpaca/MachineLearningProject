Those religion as a disease of the human mind, 
cherish also the habitual conviction that it is an evil more easily borne, even though not 
to be cured, so long as it is only insulated 
individuals here and there who are infected with it; but 
that the common danger is raised to the highest degree, 
and everything put at stake, as soon as a too close connection 
is permitted between many patients of this character. In the former case it is possible by a judicious treatment, as it were by an antiphlogistic regimen, and by a 
healthy spiritual atmosphere, to ward off the violence of 
the paroxysms ; and if not entirely to conquer the exciting 
cause of the disease, to attenuate it to such a degree that 
it shall be almost innocuous. But in the latter case we 
must despair of every other means of cure, except that 
which may proceed from some internal beneficent operation 
of Nature. For the evil is attended with more alarming 
symptoms, and is more fatal in its effects, when the too 
great proximity of other infected persons feeds and aggravates it in every individual; the whole mass of vital air is 
then quickly poisoned by a few ; the most vigorous frames 
are smitten with the contagion; all the channels in which 
the functions of life should go on are destroyed; all the 
juices of the system are decomposed; and, seized with a 
similar feverous delirium, the sound spiritual life and productions of whole ages and nations are involved in irremediable ruin. Hence your antipathy to the church, to 
every institution which is intended for the communication 
of religion, is always more prominent than that which you 
feel to religion itself; hence, also, priests, as the pillars 
and the most efficient members of such institutions, are, of 
all men, the objects of your greatest abomination. 

Even those among you who hold a little more indulgent 
opinion with regard to religion, and deem it rather a 
singularity than a disorder of the mind, an insignificant 
rather than a dangerous phenomenon, cherish quite as unfavorable impressions of all social organization for its promotion. A slavish immolation of all that is free and 
peculiar, a system of lifeless mechanism and barren ceremonies — these, they imagine, are the inseparable consequences of every such institution and are the ingenious 
and elaborate work of men, who, with almost incredible success, have made a great merit of things which are either 
nothing in themselves, or which any other person was quite 
as capable of accomplishing as they. I should pour out my 
heart but very imperfectly before you, on a subject to 
which I attach the utmost importance, if I did not undertake to give you the correct point of view with regard to it. 
I need not here repeat how many of the perverted endeavors and melancholy fortunes of humanity you charge 
upon religious associations ; this is clear as light, in a thousand utterances of your predominant individuals ; nor will 
I stop to refute these accusations, one by one, in order to 
fix the evil upon other causes. Let us rather submit the 
whole conception of the church to a new examination, and 
from its central point, throughout its whole extent, erect 
it again upon a new basis, without regard to what it has 
actually been hitherto, or to what experience may suggest 
concerning it. 
If religion exists at all, it must needs possess a social 
character; this is founded not only in the nature of man,
but still more in the nature of religion. You will acknowledge that it indicates a state of disease, a signal perversion 
of nature, when an individual wishes to shut up within 
himself anything which he has produced and elaborated by 
his own efforts. It is the disposition of man to reveal and 
to communicate whatever is in him, in the indispensable 
relations and mutual dependence not only of practical life, 
but also of his spiritual being, by which he is connected 
with all others of his race; and the more powerfully he is 
wrought upon by anything, the more deeply it penetrates 
his inward nature, so much the stronger is this social impulse, even if we regard it only from the point of view of 
the universal endeavor to behold the emotions which we 
feel ourselves, as they are exhibited by others, so that we 
may obtain a proof from their example that our own experience is not beyond the sphere of humanity.
