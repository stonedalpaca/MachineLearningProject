Still, as a refined lover and 
writer, I will endeavor to refashion the coarse occurrence 
and adapt it to my purpose. For me and for this book, 
however, for my love of it and for its inner development, 
there is no better adaptation of means to ends than this, 
namely, that right at the start I begin by abolishing what 
we call orderly arrangement, keep myself entirely aloof from 
it, frankly claiming and asserting the right to a charming 
confusion. This is all the more necessary, inasmuch as 
the material which our life and love offers to my spirit and 
to my pen is so incessantly progressive and so inflexibly 
systematic. If the form were also of that character, this, 
in its way, unique letter would then acquire an intolerable 
unity and monotony, and would no longer produce the 
desired effect, namely, to fashion and complete a most 
lovely chaos of sublime harmonies and interesting pleasures. So I use my incontestable right to a confused style 
by inserting here, in the wrong place, one of the many 
incoherent sheets which I once filled with rubbish, and 
which you, good creature, carefully preserved without my

I had written thus far to you about the things I had said 
to myself, when, in the midst of my tender thoughts and 
profound feelings about the dramatic connection of our 
embraces, a coarse and unpleasant occurrence interrupted 
me. I was just on the point of unfolding to you in clear 
and precise periods the exact and straightforward history 
of our frivolities and of my dulness. I was going to expound to you, step by step, in accordance with natural laws, 
the misunderstandings that attack the hidden centre of the 
loveliest existence, and to confess to you the manifold 
effects of my awkwardness. I was about to describe the 
apprenticeship of my manhood, a period which, taken as a 
whole or in parts, I can never look back upon without a 
great deal of inward amusement, a little melancholy, and 
considerable self-satisfaction. Still, as a refined lover and

The selection is not difficult. For since, among the 
dreamy fancies which are here confided to you in permanent letters, the recollection of this most beautiful world 
is the most significant, and has a certain sort of resemblance 
to what they call thought, I choose in preference to anything else a dithyrambic fantasy on the most lovely of situations. For once we know to a certainty that we live in 
a most beautiful world, the next need is obvious, namely, to 
inform ourselves fully, either tiirough ourselves or through 
others, about the most lovely situation in this most beautiful world.
