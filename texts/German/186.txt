The town of Gottingen, celebrated for its sau- 
sages and its University, belongs to the King 
of Hanover, and contains nine hundred and 
ninety-nine dwellings, divers churches, a lying- 
in hospital, an observatory, a prison for stu- 
dents, a library, and a Ratskeller, where the beer is 
excellent. The stream which flows by the town is called
the Leine, and is used in summer for bathing, its waters 
being very cold, and in more than one place it is so broad 
that Liider was obliged to take quite a run ere he could leap 
across. The town itself is beautiful, and pleases most when 
one's back is turned to it. It must be very ancient, for I 
well remember that five years ago, when I matriculated 
there (and shortly after received notice to quit), it had 
already the same gray, prim look, and was fully furnished 
with catch-polls, beadles, dissertations, thes dansants, 
washerwomen, compendiums, roasted pigeons, Guelphic orders, 
graduation coaches, pipe-heads, court-councilors, 
law-councilors, expelling councilors, professors ordinary and 
extraordinary. Many even assert that, at the time of the 
Great Migrations, every German tribe left behind in the 
town a loosely bound copy of itself in the person of one of 
its members, and that from these descended all the Vandals, 
Frisians, Suabians, Teutons, Saxons, Thuringians,* and 
others, who at the present day still abound in Gottingen, 
where, separately distinguished by the color of their caps 
and pipe-tassels, they may be seen straying singly or in 
hordes along the Weender Street. They still fight their 
battles on the bloody arena of the Rasenmill, Ritschenkrug, 
and Bovden, still preserve the mode of life peculiar to their 
savage ancestors, and still, as at the time of the migrations, 
are governed partly by their Duces, whom they call "chief 
cocks," and partly by their primevally ancient law-book, 
known as the Comment, which fully deserves a place among 
the leges harharorimi. 

The inhabitants of Gottingen are generally divided into 
Students, Professors, Philistines, and Cattle, the points of 
difference between these castes being by no means strictly 
defined. The "Cattle" class is the most important. I might 
be accused of prolixity should I here enumerate the names 
of all the students and of all the regular and irregular 
professors ; besides, I do not just at present distinctly 
remember the appellations of all the former gentlemen;
