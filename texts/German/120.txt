Hence it is evident that the spirit of poetry, which, though 
imperishable, migrates, as it were, through different bodies, 
must, so often as it is newly born in the human race, mold 
to itself, out of the nutrimental substance of an altered age, 
a body of a different conformation. The forms vary with 
the direction taken by the poetical sense ; and when we give 
to the new kinds of poetry the old names, and judge of 
them according to the ideas conveyed by these names, the 
application which we make of the authority of classical 
antiquity is altogether unjustifiable. No one should be 
tried before a tribunal to which he is not amenable. We 
may safely admit that most of the English and Spanish 
dramatic works are neither tragedies nor comedies in the 
sense of the ancients; they are romantic dramas. That 
the stage of a people in its foundation and formation, 
who neither knew nor wished to know anything of foreign 
models, will possess many peculiarities, and not only 
deviate from, but even exhibit a striking contrast to, the 
theatres of other nations who had a common model for 
imitation before their eyes, is easily supposable, and we 
should onlv be astonished were it otherwise. But when
in two nations, differing so widely as the English and Spanish in physical, moral, political, and religious respects, the 
theatres (which, without being known to one another, arose 
about the same time) possess, along with external and 
internal diversities, the most striking features of affinity, 
the attention even of the most thoughtless cannot but be 
turned to this phenomenon; and the conjecture will naturally occur that the same, or, at least, a kindred principle 
must have prevailed in the development of both. This 
comparison, however, of the English and Spanish theatre, 
in their common contrast with every dramatic literature 
which has grown up out of an imitation of the ancients, 
has, so far as we know, never yet been attempted. Could 
we raise from the dead a countryman, a contemporary and 
intelligent admirer of Shakespeare, and another of Calderon, and introduce to their acquaintance the works of the 
poet to which in life they were strangers, they would both, 
without doubt, considering the subject rather from a 
national than a general point of view, enter with difficulty 
into the above idea and have many objections to urge 
against it. But here a reconciling criticism* must step in ; 
and this, perhaps, may be best exercised by a German, who 
is free from the national peculiarities of either Englishmen or Spaniards, yet by inclination friendly to both, and 
prevented by no jealousy from acknowledging the greatness which has been earlier exhibited in other countries 
than his own. 

The similarity of the English and Spanish theatres does 
not consist merely in the bold neglect of the Unities of 
Place and Time, or in the commixture of comic and tragic 
elements; that they were unwilling or unable to comply
