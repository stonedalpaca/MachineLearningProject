What a horrid picture you have drawn to me of myself. 
I recognize it; I do not deserve your friendship. You are 
so noble, so kindly disposed, and now for the first time I 
do not dare to compare myself with you; I have fallen far 
below you. Alas ! for weeks I have given pain to my best, 
my noblest friends. You believe I have ceased to be kindhearted, but, thank heaven, 'tis not so! It was not intentional, thought-out malice on my part, which caused me to 
act thus ; but my unpardonable thoughtlessness, which prevented me from seeing the matter in the right light. I am 
thoroughly ashamed for your sake, also for mine. I scarcely 
venture to beg you to restore your friendship. Ah, Wegeler ! My only consolation is that you knew me almost from 
my childhood, and — oh! let me say it myself — I was really 
always of good disposition, and in my dealings always 
strove to be upright and honest; how, otherwise, could you 
have loved me ! Could I, then, in so short a time have suddenly changed so terribly, so greatly to my disadvantage! 
Impossible that these feelings for what is great and good 
should all of a sudden become extinct! My Wegeler, dear 
and best one, venture once again to come to the arms of 
your B. Trust to the good qualities which you formerly 
found in him. I will vouch for it that the pure temple of 
holy friendship which you will erect on them will forever 
stand firm ; no chance event, no storm will be able to shake 
its foundations — firm — eternal — our friendship — forgiveness — forgetting — revival of dying, sinking friendship. Oh, 
Wegeler ! do not cast off this hand of reconciliation ; place 
your hand in mine — God ! — but no more ! I myself come 
to you and throw myself in your arms, and sue for the lost 
friend, and you will give yourself to me full of contrition, 
who loves and ever will be mindful of you.
